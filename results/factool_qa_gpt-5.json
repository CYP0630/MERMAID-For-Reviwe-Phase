      "Thought: EU networks are far more electrified (≈57% of lines; most traffic on electrified lines) versus the U.S. (<1% mainline), so many European locomotives are electric and operate at higher speeds, making efficiency and aerodynamics more central. U.S. locomotives are optimized for heavy, slower freight with large loading gauges and blunt forms, where aero matters less. While not every European freight loco is streamlined, European high‑speed power cars/locos and passenger traction are notably more aerodynamic, and the system-level efficiency emphasis (electrification) is stronger.
