      "Thought: The claim is supported by optical and physiological evidence: deoxygenated and oxygenated blood are shades of red, so the blue appearance of superficial veins is not due to blue blood but to how light of different wavelengths is absorbed and scattered by the skin and the tissues above the vein, plus the visual processing of contrast and color by the eye/brain. Shorter wavelengths are scattered differently and red wavelengths penetrate deeper and are absorbed by blood, so the light returning to the observer is relatively enriched in blue/green, making veins look bluish. Multiple reputable explanations (e.g., science communications and physiology/optics literature) confirm this interpretation.",
