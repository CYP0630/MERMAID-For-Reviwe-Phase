English, when considering both native and total speakers, is often ranked third or fourth, depending on whether total speakers include non-native speakers. However, the claim of 'just over 400 million speakers' seems likely to refer to native speakers, which would position English below Mandarin and Spanish, thus not accurate for 'total number of speakers'. English ranks higher with both native and non-native speakers exceeding 1 billion total.
