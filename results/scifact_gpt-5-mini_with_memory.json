Growing evidence suggests that orexin-A is involved in the pathophysiology of depression and panic anxiety disorder. However, the role of orexin-A in PTSD remains unclear. Therefore, pharmacological manipulation of orexin-A can be a potential approach for the treatment of PTSD. Male Wistar rats were subjected to stress re-stress (SRS) by restraining them for 2 h followed by foot shock (FS) and halothane exposure on day-2 (D-2). Then the rats were weekly exposed to FS as re-stress cue . Suvorexant, an orexin antagonist (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg p.o.) and paroxetine (10 mg/kg p.o.) were administered from D-8 to D-32. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected for corticosterone and orexin-A measurement. The analysis of serotonin and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1 (CRF-R1) were performed in the amygdalar tissue. SRS-induced PTSD-like symptoms like fear response, anxiety-like behaviour and hypocorticosteronism were attenuated by suvorexant and paroxetine. Interestingly, SRS exposed rats showed activation of orexin-A and serotonergic systems, which were also attenuated by suvorexant. Additionally, suvorexant ameliorated the extrahypothalamic induced upregulation of CRH-R1 in SRS-exposed rats. Therefore, orexin-A may be considered as a neurochemical-marker for PTSD and suvorexant alleviated PTSD-like symptoms through modulating orexinergic, serotonergic and neuroendocrine systems.\",\"doi\":\"10.1016/j.bbr.2020.113015\",\"published_date\":\"2021-01-01T00:00:00\",\"pdf_url\":\"\",\"url\":\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33212086/\",\"source\":\"pubmed\",\"updated_date\":\"2021-01-01T00:00:00\",\"categories\":\"\",\"keywords\"",

The OB-projecting neurons that do not express orexin-A are located in an area of the lateral hypothalamus known to contain neurons that express the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). We used virally mediated anterograde tract tracing and immunohistochemistry for orexin-A and MCH to demonstrate that the OB is broadly innervated by axon projections from both populations of neurons with expression in each OB layer across the anterior-to-posterior axis and which overlapped with synaptophysin. Both orexin-A and MCH neurons are genetically heterogeneous, with subsets that co-express an isoform of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). We used confocal imaging to test whether the projections from orexin-A and MCH neurons to the OB reflect this glutamatergic heterogeneity. The majority of putative orexin-A axon terminals overlapped with VGLUT2, with smaller proportions that co-expressed VGLUT1 or that did not overlap with either VGLUT1 or VGLUT2. In contrast, a smaller proportion of MCH axon terminals overlapped with VGLUT2, with the majority being non-glutamatergic. Therefore, the projections from the lateral hypothalamus to the OB are genetically heterogeneous and include neurons that can release two different neuropeptides. The projections from orexin-A and MCH neuron populations are each genetically heterogeneous, with differing proportions of glutamatergic and non-glutamatergic axon terminals.\",\"doi\":\"10.1002/cne.70118\",\"published_date\":\"2026-01-01T00:00:00\",\"pdf_url\":\"\",\"url\":\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41480926/\",\"source\":\"pubmed\",\"updated_date\"",

Transforming growth factor (TGF-β), a pleiotropic cytokine, modulates fibroblast function through multiple signaling pathways, inducing cell cycle arrest, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and SASP production. These processes disrupt ECM homeostasis, exacerbate inflammation, and impair tissue repair, contributing to pathological skin changes. TGF-β induced fibroblast senescence involves multiple mechanisms and pathways. It causes cell cycle arrest by upregulating CDK inhibitors and activating the p53 pathway. TGF-β also promotes oxidative stress-induced senescence by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, activating pathways like SMAD, and causing DNA damage. In photoaging, UV exposure induces fibroblast senescence via TGF-β related mechanisms, reducing collagen production and increasing MMP levels. TGF-β also suppresses immune cell functions, creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment that accelerates cellular senescence. In refractory skin diseases like vitiligo, melanoma, and so on, TGF-β plays a complex role. Its abnormal activation drives fibroblast senescence, impacting immune responses and skin structure. However, Maintaining the normal expression of TGF-β preserves ECM homeostasis, promotes collagen synthesis, and reduces inflammatory factor expression. Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting TGF-β signaling show promise.

Animal and preclinical studies show that removing senescent cells or reducing senescence pathways improves skin structure and appearance; human molecular ageing markers (e.g., epigenetic age acceleration) also correlate with perceived/biological age.
