      "Thought: The search results from Google provide more context about 'The New Populism'. The first result from Verso Books and the second from Yale University Press both discuss 'The New Populism' in the context of political movements and political principles. The third result from Stanford Report defines populism as a political movement that represents the masses against the elites, which aligns with the general definition of populism. The fourth result from CQ Press explicitly states that populism is a political movement. These sources collectively support the claim that 'The New Populism' is a political movement.",

      "Thought: The search results for 'The New Populism and its policies' did not provide specific information about advocating for the use of silver as currency. However, the earlier search results clearly linked the Free Silver Movement with populism, and the Populists advocated for the use of silver as currency. Given that 'The New Populism' is a broader term and may refer to different movements, the specific advocacy for silver currency is more closely associated with the historical Populist movement of the late 19th century. Therefore, the statement is likely referring to the historical Populism rather than a modern 'New Populism'.",
