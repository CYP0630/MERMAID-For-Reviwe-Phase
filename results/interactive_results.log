This suggests that the Pilgrims landed in Plymouth around 1620. However, it doesn't provide direct evidence or confirmation of the exact landing year or location specifics.

Given the importance of the two key components: (1) that the location was indeed Plymouth, Massachusetts, and (2) this happened in 1620, further validation is needed to confirm both aspects definitively. It seems prudent to gather more direct historical context or check additional sources that could corroborate these claims.

To proceed, I will gather more detailed information regarding the Pilgrims' landing specifically focusing on historical records or summaries related directly to the event of their landing in Plymouth in the year 1620. 

I'll start by performing another search or summarization to gain a clear overview. Let’s progress with:
- A search for a summary to check if more detailed information can be obtained about the specific event of the landing in Plymouth in 1620.

I'll proceed with a simultaneous multi-tool approach to cover broader ground – extracting key facts and a summary for contextual verification.
