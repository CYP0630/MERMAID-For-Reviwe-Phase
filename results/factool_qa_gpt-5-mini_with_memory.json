      "Thought: Rankings by number of speakers depend on how you count a “speaker”: counting only native (L1) speakers vs total speakers (L1+L2) changes order (e.g., Mandarin highest by native speakers, English highest by total speakers). Decisions about whether to group varieties into a single ‘language’ (e.g., Mandarin vs all Chinese varieties; Arabic as one language vs many varieties; Hindi vs Hindustani/Hindi‑Urdu) also shift ranks. Other choices—minimum proficiency thresholds, self‑reported vs census data, inclusion of second‑language learners, or counting partial speakers—will alter counts and thus rankings.

      "Thought: European practice emphasizes electrification, higher-speed passenger services and smaller loading gauges, so many European traction units and EMUs are streamlined and optimized for energy efficiency; freight locos are also often lighter and designed for multi-system electric operation. By contrast North American practice traditionally prioritizes heavy diesel freight haulage with hood units where aerodynamics matter less (though recent fuel-efficiency/aerodynamic retrofits exist). Therefore the broad comparative claim is generally correct though not universal—exceptions exist by type and service.",

The U.S. has no comparable nationwide high-speed network; most intercity passenger services (Amtrak long-distance routes) operate at much lower average speeds, with only limited higher-speed segments (e.g., Acela on parts of the Northeast Corridor, some higher-speed projects) and generally lower top and average speeds; freight-dominated network also limits passenger speeds.

      "Thought: Blue light is indeed scattered more strongly in biological tissues because scattering generally decreases with increasing wavelength (shorter wavelengths scatter more). However, penetration depth depends on both scattering and absorption; tissue chromophores (e.g., hemoglobin, melanin) also absorb more strongly at shorter (blue) wavelengths. As a result, blue light penetrates less deeply than red/near-infrared light. Therefore the combined claim (scattered more AND penetrates deeper) is incorrect.",

      "Thought: The claim refers to why we perceive blue coloration (commonly applied to superficial veins). Published optics and dermatology work shows that the bluish appearance is not because the blood is intrinsically blue but because of how light is absorbed and scattered by skin and subcutaneous tissues and by visual color contrast. Longer (red) wavelengths penetrate deeper and are preferentially absorbed by blood; shorter (blue) wavelengths are more likely to be scattered back to the eye, and contrast with surrounding skin increases the blue look. Therefore the observed blue is indeed an optical effect of light interacting with skin/tissues (though blood and tissue absorption spectra and geometry are part of that explanation).

      "Thought: Populist movements historically (e.g., the U.S. People’s Party in the 1890s) emerged in reaction to rapid economic and social change—agrarian distress, industrialization, railroad and corporate concentration, and rising inequality. Modern or 'new' waves of populism have likewise often been framed as responses to economic dislocation, globalization, and the growing power of large firms. The label 'New Populism' can be used differently in different contexts, but the general claim that such populisms respond to economic and social changes from industrialization/large-scale capitalism is broadly accurate.",
