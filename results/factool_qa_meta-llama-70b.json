According to Wikipedia, fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries, but they are not Chinese in origin. Additionally, Pearl River Mart states that while Chinese restaurants all over the world serve fortune cookies, the ones in China don't.

      "Thought: The search results from Google provide more relevant information about animals on the tracks in the early days of American railroads. The article from Moving North Carolina mentions that in the 1800s, America was in a frenzy to build railroads and did not have time to build fences to keep animals off the tracks, so they equipped the locomotive with a cowcatcher. This suggests that animals were indeed present on the tracks during the early days of American railroads. I will provide the final answer based on this information.",
