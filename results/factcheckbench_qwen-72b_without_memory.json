      "Thought: The search results do not directly confirm that the gravitational pull of other objects causes giant planets to rotate faster over time. However, they do provide information on why giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn rotate quickly, which is primarily due to the conservation of angular momentum during their formation. This suggests that the initial conditions and processes during the formation of giant planets are more significant in determining their rotation speed rather than the gravitational pull of other objects over time. I will need to look for more specific evidence regarding the influence of gravitational pull from other objects on the rotation speed of giant planets.",
