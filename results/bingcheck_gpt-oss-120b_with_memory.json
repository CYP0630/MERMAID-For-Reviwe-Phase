      "Thought: The claim that the first crossword puzzle was titled “FUN’s Word-Cross Puzzle” needs verification. Historical sources commonly state that Arthur Wynne's puzzle, published on December 21, 1913 in the New York World, was called “Word‑Cross”. Some references note it appeared in the newspaper’s “FUN” section, leading to the phrasing “FUN’s Word‑Cross Puzzle”. However, primary evidence (e.g., archived newspaper scans) shows the title printed as “Word‑Cross” without the “FUN’s” prefix. Therefore, the specific claim that the first crossword was titled exactly “FUN’s Word‑Cross Puzzle” is not supported by the primary title; it is a secondary description. The statement is false.",
