      "Thought: The observations from various reliable sources such as Wikipedia, and Guinness World Records, indicate that the peregrine falcon can indeed reach remarkable high speeds, particularly during its stoop (dive). However, the most commonly cited maximum speed during a dive is around 320 km/h (200 mph), typically mentioned across multiple sources. While there are experimental instances suggesting the possibility of exceeding this, with speeds up to 389 km/h (242 mph) mentioned by the Guinness World Records, these may not be the standard or commonly observed speeds. Therefore, the claim that the peregrine falcon can reach speeds of 'over 386 kilometers per hour' seems to be an exceptional case rather than a typical speed.",
