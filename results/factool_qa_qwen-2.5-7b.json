      "Thought: Historical records, legal changes, and contemporary accounts show livestock and other animals frequently wandered onto early American railroad tracks. 19th‑century sources note trains were ‘‘in perpetual danger from cattle straying,’’ states passed or considered ‘stock laws’ and required railroads to fence or compensate for stray animals, and railroads and ranchers repeatedly disputed responsibility for animals on the line. These facts support the claim that many animals were on the tracks in the early days of American railroads.",

      "Thought: The phrase 'New Populism' commonly denotes a recent/resurgent form of populism (e.g., 21st-century movements like those around Bernie Sanders), while the late 19th-century movement in the United States is the original Populist movement (the People’s Party/agrarian Populism).
