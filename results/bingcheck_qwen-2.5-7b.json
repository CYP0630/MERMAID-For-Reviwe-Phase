The claim that he 'suffered from a severe form of tinnitus, meaning he heard a constant ringing' is largely supported (contemporary letters and reports describe persistent ringing), and that the autopsy revealed inner ear pathology that had developed over time is also supported, though exact wording about a 'distended inner ear' and 'lesions' is imprecise.

Other studies show that for many users, multiple channels (offline media, mainstream outlets, social ties) provide cross-cutting information, so filter bubbles are not uniform or absolute. However, personalization, selective exposure, and network homophily do create echo chambers for some users and can amplify misinformation, meaning the problem is real for subsets of the population even if not universal.

Psychological flexibility is a core resilience factor (e.g., adaptive coping, cognitive reappraisal, ACT literature), and forgiveness is linked to reduced negative affect and better recovery after interpersonal and personal setbacks. Mechanistically, flexibility allows switching to effective strategies when prior approaches fail, and forgiveness prevents prolonged blame/shame that blocks problem‑solving and engagement.

Practically, current quantum devices are limited by qubit count, noise, and huge error-correction overheads, so classical machines still outperform them on most real-world workloads. Likewise, scaling behavior depends on the problem: some problems admit exponential or polynomial quantum speedups, but building and error-correcting large-scale quantum hardware is extremely challenging, while classical hardware also scales (albeit with different limits).

      "Thought: Beethoven did begin experiencing hearing loss around  mid-1790s (commonly dated to 1796 when he was about 26), and by the 1810s he was nearly totally deaf and was effectively completely deaf by the time of his death in 1827. However, the claim that he was 'at the peak of his career' at age 26 is misleading—his major 'middle' or 'heroic' period and greatest fame came later (roughly 1800–1812). Because the bundled statement mixes a correct timing of onset and deafness-at-death with an inaccurate claim about being at his career peak at 26, the overall statement is false.",

Greenhouse-gas outcomes are more conditional: cultured meat often shows lower GHGs in scenarios using low-carbon energy but can have higher GHGs if production relies on fossil-fuel electricity because of high energy demand. Separately, authoritative sources (FAO and IPCC summaries) identify animal agriculture as a major contributor to greenhouse-gas emissions, extensive land use, high water demand, and various forms of pollution.

Winglets (wingtip devices) reduce induced drag by weakening wingtip vortices, improving lift efficiency (better lift-to-drag) and fuel economy.
