      "Thought: There is documented footage (BBC’s Spy in the Pod and subsequent reportage in Smithsonian, Discover, etc.) showing bottlenose dolphins gently handling and passing a toxic pufferfish, nibbling it, then entering a lethargic/trance-like state, sometimes floating near the surface. Reporters and the film’s researchers suggested the puffer’s neurotoxin (tetrodotoxin) in small doses could have a narcotic effect, and the dolphins were observed passing the fish among the pod. However, scientists emphasize this is circumstantial — it documents the behavior but does not prove intentional, routine ‘drug use’ or that mesmerisation by reflections is the cause. Given that the core observable claims (passing pufferfish, floating in a trance-like state) are supported by filmed evidence and expert speculation, but the interpretation as deliberate recreational drug use is tentative, the statement is best judged as supported by evidence but not definitively proven.

The structure comprised about 18,038 pieces of puddled (wrought) iron and was assembled with roughly 2.5 million rivets.

      "Thought: The claim overstates consensus: filter bubbles were highlighted by Pariser and many empirical studies show algorithmic personalization can reduce exposure to cross-cutting viewpoints, while social-network structure and users’ own choices (homophily, selective exposure) often produce echo chambers. Key evidence: Bakshy et al. (Science 2015) found algorithms do limit exposure but individual sharing patterns matter more; other work and internal platform research (e.g., Facebook) show algorithmic ranking and recommender systems can amplify partisan or misleading content for some users. At the same time, people often encounter diverse sources via friends, mainstream media, search, and offline contacts, so effects are heterogeneous across users. Overall, filter-bubble effects are real and can be consequential for polarization and misinformation for many users, even if not universal, so the blanket claim that they are “not as prevalent or problematic” is misleading/false.",

Because the Greek version was readable, scholars (notably Thomas Young and especially Jean-François Champollion, who announced his decipherment in 1822) used the trilingual inscriptions and knowledge of Coptic to establish the phonetic values of hieroglyphs. This breakthrough allowed systematic translation of Egyptian inscriptions and greatly expanded understanding of ancient Egyptian language, history, and culture. Therefore the claim is correct.",

      "Thought: Biogeography—patterns of where species live—supports evolution because related species tend to cluster geographically, reflecting descent with modification from local ancestors. Classic examples: island species (Galápagos finches) closely resemble mainland relatives; distinct faunas on continents (marsupials in Australia) reflect historical isolation and common ancestry. While convergence can produce similar forms in different regions, the overall geographic clustering of related taxa is predicted by evolutionary history and was used by Darwin and Wallace as evidence. Therefore the statement is correct.",

The FBI’s released file (about 1,400 pages) documents monitoring of his mail, phone calls, visits and other inquiries; J. Edgar Hoover and the Bureau repeatedly flagged Einstein’s political activities and associations as potentially 'leftist' or communist-influenced. Given the duration, the documented surveillance activities, and explicit FBI suspicions about communist sympathies in Bureau communications and press coverage (e.g., New York Times, National Geographic summaries of the files), the claim is supported.",

      "Thought: Beethoven was born in 1770 and began noticing hearing problems in his mid‑20s (around 1796–1798), so the age 26 part is essentially correct. However, calling him “at the peak of his career” at 26 is misleading: his major middle and late‑period masterpieces (often considered his peak) came later (from about 1800–1815 onward). By the time of his death in 1827 he was effectively totally deaf (autopsy and contemporaneous reports confirm severe nerve atrophy), so the final clause is accurate. Because the statement’s middle claim (peak of his career at age 26) is incorrect/misleading, the overall composite claim is False.",

      "Thought: Avoiding fast fashion reduces demand for high-volume, resource- and energy-intensive garment production and slows the turnover of clothing. Buying less lowers the number of garments produced (fewer raw materials, less manufacturing energy, and fewer transport emissions). Choosing higher-quality items increases garment lifespan and reduces per-wear environmental impacts. Shopping second-hand and swapping extend the service life of existing garments, displacing new production and keeping textiles out of landfill longer. Together these actions reduce textile waste, lower lifecycle greenhouse-gas emissions per unit of use, and decrease other impacts (water, chemical pollution, resource use); caveats include care-related emissions, transport for resale, and potential rebound effects if consumers replace purchases elsewhere, but the net effect is a reduction in emissions, waste, and overall environmental impact.

      "Thought: Authoritative sources (NHTSA) are the origin of the frequently quoted “94%” figure: NHTSA has said human choices are linked to about 94% of serious crashes (from its crash-causation work and a 2016 press release). However, that phrasing is often misused — it refers to driver-related ‘‘critical reasons’’ or ‘‘human choices’’ in serious crashes and does not mean that 94% of all traffic collisions would be fully prevented simply by removing human drivers. The causal picture is more complex (multiple contributing factors, vehicle/environmental causes, and new failure modes introduced by automation). It is plausible and supported by research that automated driving could reduce many fatalities by addressing human error, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate those crashes or to prevent exactly the quoted fraction. Because the 94% statistic is context-dependent/misleading and the stronger causal claim is uncertain, the composite claim as stated is not supported.",

      "Thought: Historical records show the Cuban Missile Crisis was resolved by a public agreement where the USSR removed its missiles from Cuba and the US publicly pledged not to invade Cuba. Privately, US officials (notably Robert Kennedy) negotiated a secret understanding with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that the United States would remove its Jupiter missiles from Turkey (and pressure NATO allies) in the months after the crisis; the Jupiters were withdrawn in 1963. Thus the claim—that Kennedy secretly agreed to remove US nuclear missiles from Turkey in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba—is accurate (with the nuance that the Turkey removal was a secret, delayed element of the settlement).",

However, outcomes are sensitive to assumptions about production processes, growth media, and especially energy/carbon intensity of the electricity used; some near‑term scenarios show equal or higher energy use and potentially higher GHGs if powered by fossil electricity. Independent sources (FAO/others) also confirm animal agriculture is a major source of GHGs, land use, water use, and pollution. Given the evidence, the claim as stated — that lab‑grown meat could be more sustainable and potentially reduce those environmental impacts — is supported though contingent on technology and energy choices.",
