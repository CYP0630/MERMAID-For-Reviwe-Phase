In 1984 China won 5 golds, 11 silvers, and 5 bronzes. From 1988 onwards the medal haul increased steadily: 1992 (17 gold, 15 silver, 13 bronze), 1996 (16G, 11S, 8B), 2000 (28G, 18S, 23B), 2004 (32G, 15S, 20B), 2008 (48G, 22S, 30B), 2012 (38G, 27S, 23B), 2016 (26G, 18S, 26B), 2020 (38G, 32S, 21B).

Historical analyses (e.g., works on the Atlantic economy, African economic transformation, and the rise of cash crops like cocoa, coffee, ivory, and later rubber) document how the decline of the transatlantic slave market opened new commercial opportunities, encouraged the establishment of plantation agriculture, and prompted infrastructural developments that fostered nascent market economies.
