      "Thought: The search results provide references to multiple sources stating that the first large-scale desalination plant was built in Aruba in 1930. Although one source mentions that the plant opened in 1932, other sources confirm that 1930 marks the establishment of large-scale desalination efforts in Aruba, and additional support from reputable publications like Springer Nature affirm the claim.
